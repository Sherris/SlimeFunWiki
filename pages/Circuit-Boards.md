Circuit Boards are [Technical Components](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Technical-Components) that can be used in various crafting recipes.

## Obtaining
### Basic Circuit Board
The Basic Circuit Board can be obtained by manually killing an Iron Golem. Upon the death of the Iron Golem, it has a chance of dropping one Basic Circuit Board. This chance is 75% by default, but it can be changed in the configuration files by a server operator.

### Advanced Circuit Board
Combining the following items in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table) yields one Advanced Circuit Board:

* 1 Basic Circuit Board
* 6 Blocks of Lapis Lazuli
* 2 Blocks of Redstone
